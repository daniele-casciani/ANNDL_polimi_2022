# AN2DL-challenge2

## Overview

Welcome to the **AN2DL-challenge2** repository! This repository contains the submission to the second challenge of the course **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** at Politecnico di Milano.

### Team Information

- Team name: **NonDormoLucido**
- University: **Politecnico di Milano, Laurea Magistrale (MSc) - Computer Science and Engineering**

## Challenge Description

The challenge was part of the course project and focused on Neural Networks and time series classification. Participants had two weeks to develop notebooks related to the task. The provided dataset was in zipped format, and a private test set was held by the professors to evaluate the models. The challenge allowed participation in groups of three, and the main objective was to explore the world of Time Series classification and gain experience in this field.

## Dataset Description

The zipped file of the dataset contained a folder named "train," which included various time series samples. Participants were responsible for pre-processing tasks, such as data splitting and any required augmentation on the time series. The challenge encouraged the implementation of different techniques for time series classification, such as *attention*, and the exploration of various approaches.

## Team Approach

We approached the challenge by collectively defining three different methods to solve the problem. Each team member took responsibility for developing one of these approaches. We maintained regular communication to discuss ideas and progress and collectively agreed on key decisions that influenced our chosen approach.

## Replicating Our Results

Please exercise caution when running the provided notebooks. The paths to folders (e.g., checkpoints, testing, or loading images) might differ due to varying environments. To replicate our results, **adjust the folder paths** according to your system setup. We primarily used Google Colab in conjunction with Google Drive.

## Version Control

As we extensively utilized Google Colab and worked on Google Drive, we could not maintain copies of every single change on GitHub. Therefore, we have included only the final submission folder as the main reference.

## Submission Details

As part of the challenge requirements, we submitted all the scripts used, thoroughly commented notebooks, and a final report of maximum 3 pages, explaining our approach.

## Scoring

The evaluation for the course consisted of the following components:

- 20 points for the written exam
- 5 + 0.5 points for challenge 1
- 5 + 0.5 points for challenge 2

Additional bonus points (0.5) were available for exceptional work, which could contribute towards reaching 31 points and achieving laude.

In this challenge, we were able to achieve the maximum points (5.5) for our submission.

Thank you for visiting our repository and exploring our work! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us. We hope our efforts in tackling this challenge will be helpful and insightful for you in your own explorations of Neural Networks and time series classification.
