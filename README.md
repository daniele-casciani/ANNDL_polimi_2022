# ANNDL (Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning) Repository

Welcome to the **ANNDL** repository! This repository contains the submissions for the challenges of the course **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** at Politecnico di Milano.

## About the Course

The **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course at Politecnico di Milano focuses on advanced concepts and practical applications of neural networks and deep learning. Through a series of challenging tasks and projects, participants get hands-on experience in tackling real-world problems using cutting-edge techniques in the field.

## Challenges Overview

This repository includes the solutions for two challenges:

### Challenge 1 - Plant Classification

- The goal of this challenge was to detect the type of a plant based on its leaves using Neural Networks for image classification.
- Participants had two weeks to develop notebooks and were provided with a zipped dataset containing images of plant leaves.
- The professors held a private test set for evaluating the models, and the mean accuracy was used as the performance metric.
- Participants could participate in groups of three and were encouraged to explore the world of image classification and gain valuable experience in this domain.

### Challenge 2 - Time Series Classification

- The second challenge focused on time series classification using Neural Networks.
- Participants again had two weeks to develop notebooks, and the provided dataset was in a zipped format.
- The professors kept a private test set for scoring models.
- Similar to the first challenge, participants could form groups of three to participate and aimed to gain more experience in the field of time series classification.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders, one for each challenge:

- **Homework_1**: Contains the submission for Challenge 1, which involves plant classification based on leaves using Neural Networks.
- **Homework_2**: Contains the submission for Challenge 2, which focuses on time series classification using Neural Networks.

Each challenge folder includes the notebooks, scripts, and any additional resources used for the respective task.

## Replicating Our Results

To replicate the results, follow the instructions provided in the respective challenge folders. Be cautious when running the notebooks, as paths to folders (e.g., checkpoints, datasets) may need adjustments based on your system setup. The challenges were primarily developed using Google Colab with Google Drive.

## Version Control

Since we worked extensively with Google Colab and Google Drive, we could not maintain copies of every single change on GitHub. Therefore, we have included only the final submission folders as the main references.

## Submission Details

As part of the challenges, we submitted all the scripts used, thoroughly commented notebooks, and a final report explaining the approaches followed.

## Scoring

The evaluation for the course consisted of written exams and scores from both challenges. Bonus points were available for exceptional work, contributing to a maximum total of 31 points and the possibility of receiving laude.

We successfully achieved maximum points (5.5) in both challenges.

Thank you for visiting our repository and exploring our work! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us. We hope our efforts in tackling these challenges will be helpful and insightful for you in your own explorations of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
