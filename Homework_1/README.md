# AN2DL-challenge1

## Overview

Welcome to the **AN2DL-challenge1** repository! This repository contains the submission for the first challenge of the course **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** at Politecnico di Milano.

### Team Information

- Team name: **NonDormoLucido**
- University: **Politecnico di Milano, Laurea Magistrale (MSc) - Computer Science and Engineering**

### Challenge Details

- Challenge Name: Challenge 1
- University: Politecnico di Milano, Laurea Magistrale (MSc) - Computer Science and Engineering

## Challenge Description

The challenge was a part of the course project and focused on Neural Networks and image classification. Participants had two weeks to develop notebooks related to Neural Networks with the goal of detecting the type of a plant based on its leaves. The dataset, provided in a zipped format, was given by the professors, who kept a private test set for evaluating the models. The performance metric used to compute a "leaderboard" was the mean accuracy. Participants were allowed to form groups of three to participate in the challenge. The primary objective of this competition was to explore the world of Image Classification and gain as much experience as possible in this field.

## Dataset Description

The zipped file of the dataset contained a folder named "train," which included leaves from different plant classes. Participants were responsible for pre-processing tasks, such as data splitting and any required image augmentation techniques. We developed custom scripts to facilitate better management of the dataset.

## Team Approach

We collaborated and agreed upon three different approaches to solve the problem. Each team member took ownership of developing one approach, and we communicated regularly to share ideas and progress. The main ideas were combined, and together we applied them to the chosen approach.

## Replicating Our Results

When running the provided notebooks, exercise caution as the paths to folders (e.g., checkpoints, testing, or loading images) may vary due to different environments. To replicate our results, **adjust the folder paths** according to your system setup. We primarily used Google Colab in conjunction with Google Drive for our development.

## Version Control

Since we extensively worked with Google Colab on Google Drive, we were unable to maintain copies of every single change on GitHub. Therefore, we have included only the final submission folder as the main reference.

## Submission Details

As part of the challenge requirements, we submitted all the scripts used, thoroughly commented notebooks, and a final report of maximum 3 pages, explaining our approach.

## Scoring

The evaluation for the course consisted of the following components:

- 20 points for the written exam
- 5 + 0.5 points for challenge 1
- 5 + 0.5 points for challenge 2

Bonus points (0.5) were available for outstanding work, contributing to a maximum of 31 points and the possibility of receiving laude.

In this challenge, we successfully achieved all the points (5.5) for our submission.

Thank you for visiting our repository and exploring our work! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us. We hope our efforts in tackling this challenge will be helpful and insightful for you in your own explorations of Neural Networks and image classification.
