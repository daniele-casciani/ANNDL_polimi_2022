#Image Classification

Welcome to the first Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course! You have the opportunity to test what you learned during the course. We set up a competition to make things more fun! ðŸ˜Ž

In this homework you are required to classify species of plants (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.


Please find the dataset details at Participate/Get Data page and a description of the evaluation procedure at the Learn the Details/Evaluation page. We recommend to read the instructions carefully in all the pages and to check the Learn the Details/Rules page before starting submitting.
